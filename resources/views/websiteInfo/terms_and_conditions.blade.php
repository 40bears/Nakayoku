                        These Terms will apply to any contract between us for the sale of Products to you (Contract).

                        2.1 The images of the Products on our site are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer’s display of the colours accurately reflect the colour of the Products. Your Products may vary slightly from those images.<br><br>

                        2.2 Although we have made every effort to be as accurate as possible, because our Products are handmade, any measurements indicated on our site have a 5% tolerance. <br><br>

                        2.3 The packaging of the Products may vary from that shown on images on our site. <br><br>

                        3. Use of our site <br>
                        Your use of our site is governed by our Terms + Conditions. Please take the time to read these, as they include important terms which apply to you.<br><br>

                        4. How we use your personal information<br>
                        We only use your personal information in accordance with our privacy policy and cookie policy. Please take the time to read this, as it includes important terms which apply to you.<br><br>


                        5. If you are a consumer <br>
                        If you are a consumer, you may only purchase Products from our site if you are at least 18 years old.<br><br>

                        6.1 If you are not a consumer, you confirm that you have authority to bind any business on whose behalf you use our site to purchase Products.<br><br>

                        6.2 These Terms and any document expressly referred to in them constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede and extinguish all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating to their subject matter.<br><br>

                        6.3 You acknowledge that in entering into this Contract you do not rely on any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms or any document expressly referred to in them.<br><br>

                        6.4 You and we agree that neither of us shall have any claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in this Contract. <br><br>


                        7. How the contract is formed between you and us <br>
                        7.1 Our shopping pages will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order with us. Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Please take the time to read and check your order at each page of the order process.<br><br>

                        7.2 After you place an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order. The Contract between us will only be formed when we send you the order confirmation (Order Confirmation).<br><br>

                        7.3 If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example because that Product is not in stock or is no longer available, because we cannot meet your requested delivery date, or because of an error in the price on our site as referred to in clause 12.5, we will inform you of this by email and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Products, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible.<br><br>


                        8. Our right to vary these terms<br>
                        8.1 We may amend these Terms from time to time. Please look at the top of this page to see when these Terms were last updated and which Terms were changed.<br><br>

                        8.2 Every time you order Products from us, the Terms in force at the time of your order will apply to the Contract between you and us.<br><br>

                        8.3 We may revise these Terms as they apply to your order from time to time to reflect the following circumstances:<br><br>

                        (a) changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and / or<br><br>

                        (b) changes in how we take payment from you.<br><br>

                        8.4 If we have to revise these Terms as they apply to your order, we will contact you to give you reasonable advance notice of the changes, and let you know how to cancel the Contract if you are not happy with the changes. You may cancel either in respect of all the affected Products or just the Products you have yet to receive. If you opt to cancel, you will have to return (at our cost) any relevant Products you have already received and we will arrange a full refund of the price you have paid, including any delivery charges.<br><br>


                        9. Your consumer right of return and refund<br>
                        This clause 9 only applies if you are a consumer.<br><br>

                        9.1 If you are a consumer, you have a legal right to cancel a Contract under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 during the period set out below in clause 9.3. This means that during the relevant period if you change your mind or decide for any other reason that you do not want to receive or keep a Product, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the Contract and receive a refund. Advice about your legal right to cancel the Contract is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.<br><br>

                        9.2 However, please note that this cancellation right does not apply in the case of Products made to your specific requirements or measurements (in other words, outside of the standard range of options we offer), or which are personalised or are otherwise bespoke, for example Products which are ordered through our “Perfect Fit” service.<br><br>

                        9.3 Your legal right to cancel a Contract starts from the date of the Order Confirmation (the date on which we email you to confirm our acceptance of your order), which is when the Contract between us is formed. Your deadline for cancelling the Contract is 1 hour.<br><br>

                        9.4 To cancel a Contract, you just need to let us know that you have decided to cancel within 1 hour of placing your order. The easiest way to do this is to email us at hello@globalcarpatica-dmp.com.<br><br>

                        9.5 If you cancel your Contract we will:<br><br>

                        (a) refund you the price you paid for the Products. However, please note we are permitted by law to reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of the Products, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the Products, and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.<br><br>

                        (b) refund any delivery costs you have paid, although, as permitted by law, the maximum refund will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer (provided that this is a common and generally acceptable method). For example, if we offer delivery of a Product within 7 days at one cost, but you choose to have the Product delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.<br><br>

                        (c) make any refunds due to you as soon as possible and in any event within the deadlines indicated below:<br><br>

                        (i) if you have received the Product and we have not offered to collect it from you: 14 days after the day on which we receive the Product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the Product back to us. For information about how to return a Product to us, see clause 9.8;<br><br>

                        (ii) if you have not received the Product, or you have received it and we have offered to collect it from you: 14 days after you inform us of your decision to cancel the Contract.<br><br>

                        9.6 If you have returned the Products to us under this clause 9 because they are faulty or mis-described, we will refund the price of the Products in full, together with any applicable delivery charges. We will arrange for collection of the Products from you, and we will pay the costs of returning the item to us. <br><br>

                        9.7 We will refund you on the credit card or debit card used by you to pay. If you used vouchers to pay for the Product we may refund you in vouchers.<br><br>

                        9.8 If a Product has been delivered to you before you decide to cancel your Contract:<br><br>

                        (a) then you must return it to us without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days after the day on which you let us know that you wish to cancel the Contract. You must send the Product back to us (unless the Product is faulty or not as described, in which case we will arrange collection as set out in clause 9.6 above). Please see our Exchanges and Refunds page for details of how to do this;<br><br>

                        (b) unless the Product is faulty or not as described (in this case, see clause 9.6), you will be responsible for the cost of returning the Products to us;<br><br>

                        9.9 Because you are a consumer, we are under a legal duty to supply Products that are in conformity with this Contract. As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to Products that are faulty or not as described. These legal rights are not affected by your right of return and refund in this clause 9 or anything else in these Terms. Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. We're not able to make changes or cancel orders once they've been placed. If you do wish to return please follow our Simple + Easy Returns process.<br><br>

                        9.10 Note - all items ordered from the SUPER COOL SH*T: Bespoke Art Service range are non returnable/refundable. If an order is cancelled, there will be a non refundable deposit of 15% of the total value of your order before the painting has began, OR, there will be a non refundable deposit of 100% of the total value of your order after the painting has began.<br><br>
                        We strongly advise against wearing your SUPER COOL SH*T jacket in heavy rain. GLOBAL CARPATICA SL holds no responsibility for evidence of wear and tear or water damage post purchase. The jacket will be non returnable in this instance.
                        9.11 Each engraving plate is customised per order. Therefore, we are unable to offer a refund for this item.<br><br>
                        10. Delivery<br>
                        10.1 We will contact you with an estimated delivery date, which will be within 30 days after the date of the Order Confirmation (the date on which we email you to confirm our acceptance of your order)]. Occasionally our delivery to you may be affected by an Event Outside Our Control. See clause 16 for our responsibilities when this happens.<br><br>

                        10.2 If no one is available at your address to take delivery, we will leave you a note that the Products have been returned to our premises, in which case, please contact the carrier to rearrange delivery.<br><br>

                        10.3 Delivery of an order shall be completed when we deliver the Products to the address you gave us, and the Products will be your responsibility from that time.<br><br>

                        10.4 You own the Products once we have received payment in full, including all applicable delivery charges.<br><br>

                        This clause 10.5 only applies if you are a consumer.<br><br>

                        10.5 If we miss the 30-day delivery deadline for any Products, then you may cancel your order straight away if any of the following apply:<br><br>

                        (a) we have refused to deliver the Products;<br><br>

                        (b) delivery within the delivery deadline was essential (taking into account all the relevant circumstances); or<br><br>

                        (c) you told us before we accepted your order that delivery within the delivery deadline was essential.<br><br>

                        10.6 If you do not wish to cancel your order straight away, or do not have the right to do so under clause 10.5, you can give us a new deadline for delivery, which must be reasonable, and you can cancel your order if we do not meet the new deadline.<br><br>

                        10.7 If you do choose to cancel your order for late delivery under clause 10.6 or clause 10.7, you can do so for just some of the Products or all of them, unless splitting them up would significantly reduce their value. If the Products have been delivered to you, you will have to return them to us or allow us to collect them, and we will pay the costs of this. After you cancel your order we will refund any sums you have paid to us for the cancelled Products and their delivery.<br><br>


                        11. International delivery <br>
                        11.1 We deliver worldwide (International Delivery Destinations). However there are restrictions on some Products for certain International Delivery Destinations (such as import restrictions or bans) which are outside our control, so please check whether any such restrictions apply before ordering Products from us, as we cannot accept responsibility for this.<br><br>

                        11.2 If you order Products from our site for delivery to one of the International Delivery Destinations, your order may be subject to import duties and taxes which are applied when the delivery reaches that destination. Please note that we have no control over these charges and we cannot predict their amount.<br><br>

                        11.3 You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.<br><br>

                        11.4 You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the Products are destined. We will not be liable or responsible if you break any such law.<br><br>


                        12. Price of products and delivery charges<br>
                        12.1 The prices of the Products will be as quoted on our site at the time you submit your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Products are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system. However please see clause 12.5 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of Product(s) you ordered.<br><br>

                        12.2 Prices for our Products may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order you have already placed.<br><br>

                        12.3 The price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate chargeable in the UK for the time being. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.<br><br>

                        12.4 The price of a Product does not include delivery charges. Our delivery charges are as advised to you during the check-out process, before you confirm your order. To check relevant delivery charges, please refer to our Delivery page.<br><br>

                        12.5 Our site contains a large number of Products. It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Products on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that:<br><br>

                        (a) where the Product's correct price is less than the price stated on our site, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Products to you. However, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a miss-pricing, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price; and<br><br>

                        (b) if the Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will contact you in writing as soon as possible to inform you of this error, and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing.<br><br>


                        13. How to pay<br>
                        13.1 You can only pay for Products using a debit card or credit card. We accept all of the major credit and debit cards, or you can make your payment using Paypal, Klarna, LayBuy or Sofort (on the de.globalcarpatica.com website).<br><br>

                        18.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms. We will always notify you by posting on this webpage if this happens.<br><br>

                        18.2 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.<br><br>

                        18.4 Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.<br><br>

                        18.5 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.<br><br>

                        18.6 If you are a consumer, please note that these Terms are governed by English law. This means that a Contract for the purchase of Products through our site and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by English law.

However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.<br><br>

                        18.8 If you are a business, we both irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with a Contract or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).<br><br>
